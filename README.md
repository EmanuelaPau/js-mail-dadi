<p>
The game will generate two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating two dices rolling. <br>
The dice with the higher number will be the winner. If the dices give the same number the result will be Draw.

<br>
<h2>-- EMAIL VERIFER  --</h2>
This is a email verifier <strong>built with JS</strong>, that will tell if the email written by the user is in the list of the guests of the party. <br>
<h2>Are you invited to Topolino party?</h2 >

<br>
<p>
Given a guests list, and given the user's email (that he will write in an input) the program will check if the user is invited to the party, or not.<br>
This program was created as an exercise to better understand <strong>for loop</strong> and <strong>arrays</strong>. The goal was to achieve a working program without using .include or While loops.
